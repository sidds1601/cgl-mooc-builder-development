  '<p><b>1.</b> In this example given, the winning strategy for calculating accuracy was:</p>',

  { questionType: 'multiple choice',
    choices: [['Data mining on the Web', false, 'Please try again.'],
              ['Application of multiple algorithms', false, 'Please try again.'],
              ['More data led to more accuracy', true, 'Correct!'],
              ['Better algorithms led to more accuracy', false, 'Please try again.']]},
			  
  "<p><b>2.</b> Evaluate some common recommender systems (eBay, Netflix) in regards to how accurate they are in predicting your own likes.</p>",

  "<p><b>3.</b> Consider the problem posed at <a href='http://www.kaggle.com/c/job-recommendation' target='_blank'>http://www.kaggle.com/c/job-recommendation</a> Abstract this challenge as the design of a recommendation system for job sites like <a href='http://www.careerbuilder.com/' target='_blank'>http://www.careerbuilder.com</a> and <a href='http://www.monster.com' target='_blank'>http://www.monster.com</a>. Recommendation engines can be user-based collaborative filtering (users are job applicants), item-based collaborative filtering (items are jobs and employers) or content based (content is parameters of job and employers) or a brilliant new idea or any combination thereof. Write an essay (a page or so) on these different approaches and discuss their implementation and potential without going into details of technology.
