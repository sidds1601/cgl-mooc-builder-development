    {questionHTML: "<p>We reviewed in the class several Big Data Application Areas X with particular examples. We can classify most of them in broad areas:</p><ul><li>Internet</li><li>Commerce</li><li>Industry</li><li>Sensors</li><li>Medical/Health</li><li>Science</li></ul><br><p>Identify 2 Application areas with a specific example that interest you and write at most half a page on each as to why interesting and what the key aspects of data and analytics are. These should be different from examples I gave but can be related. For example you could choose commerce but cover different example such as Amazon rather than eBay. The 2 applications should be in different categories of the 6 above.</p>",
