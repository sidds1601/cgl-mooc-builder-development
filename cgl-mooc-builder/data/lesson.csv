11,Using Plotviz Software for Displaying Point Distributions in 3D,1,Motivation and Introduction to use,,,assets/slides/Lecture_11.pdf,4aQlCmQ1jfY,"<p>The motivation of Plotviz is that the human eye is very good at pattern recognition and can ''see'' structure in data. Although most Big data is higher dimensional than 3, all data can be transformed by dimension reduction techniques to 3D and one can check analysis like clustering and/or see structure missed in a computer analysis. The motivations shows some Cheminformatics examples. The use of Plotviz is started in slide 4 with a discussion of input file which is either a simple text or more features (like colors) can be specified in a rich XML syntax. Plotviz deals with points and their classification (clustering). Next the protein sequence browser in 3D shows the basic structure of Plotviz interface.
